Lesson 250 From Merging with Siva

The State Of Resolve

When you hear the high-pitched sound “eee” in your head, your karma and your dharma are at that moment well balanced in this life. This is reassuring to know, as is the fact that if you persist in this state for an exceedingly long period of time, you would come into the realization of the experience of God. However, as you doubtless have already experienced, distractions you have set into motion teasingly bring awareness into another area, and almost without your knowing it, the high-pitched “eee” sound has faded and a thought has taken its place.

When you are in a state of resolve—and resolve is the key word here; this means you have resolved the major karmas of conflict—good fortune and all the emotions arise, both generated through understanding the awakened philosophies by the practice of yoga and the results obtained. Then the karmas of the head chakras begin to unfold, resulting in these sublime feelings. These karmas are only experienced after many Paraśiva experiences, but they are felt before as a blissful impending future. It is from these karmas the word bliss derives. Only beyond the beyond the beyond—within the vastness within the heart and core of the universes, when space turns to spacelessness, time stops and māyā’s endless cycles are no more—are there no more karmas. Māyā’s endless cycle of creation, preservation and dissolution are karmas in the manifold creations of this process.
