Raising Sons for the Monastery 

SŪTRA 284: PARENTS OF MONASTICS EXPECT NO PRIVILEGES
My devotees with a monastic son never claim special access or privileges based on blood ties. They dissociate from him and do not involve themselves in his life or seek to influence our Śaiva Church through him. Aum.
