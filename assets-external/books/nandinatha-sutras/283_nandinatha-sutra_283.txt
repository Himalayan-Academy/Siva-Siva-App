Raising Sons for the Monastery 

SŪTRA 283: SATGURU GUIDES THE LIFE OF DEDICATED SONS
My devotees regard any son destined for the monastery not as their own child, but as the satguru’s progeny in their trusted care. All details of his upbringing, training and education are to be guided by the preceptor. Aum.
