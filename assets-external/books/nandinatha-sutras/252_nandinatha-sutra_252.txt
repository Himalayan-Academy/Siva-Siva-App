Nandinātha Sūtras
In the Satguru’s Presence

SŪTRA 252: SHOWING RESPECT TO THE PRECEPTOR
Śiva’s devotees never stand or sit above their satguru, walk or drive ahead of him, take a place of authority or instruct others in his presence unless invited. All Hindus are sensitive in a guru’s lofty company. Aum.
