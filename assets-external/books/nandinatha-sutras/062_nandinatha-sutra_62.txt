Regrettable Exceptions to Ahiṁsā 

SŪTRA 62: SELF-DEFENSE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT
Śiva’s devotees faced with imminent danger may elect to injure or kill to protect their life or that of another, or to defend the community as a soldier or a law officer in the line of duty. This is ahiṁsā’s first exception. Aum.
