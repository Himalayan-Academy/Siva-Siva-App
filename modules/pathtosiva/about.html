Why is the <i>Path to Siva</i> so important?
</b></p>

<p>There are 68 Lessons in the <i>Path to Siva</i>. They bring you close to the living sampradaya at Kauai Aadheenam. We, as 21st century people from all over the world, could well be called the heirs of the "Adi Saivas," "First to worship Siva," a tradition that goes beyond time and history.</p>

   This book is a short summary of the beliefs, practices and theology of Saiva Siddhanta, one of the great streams of the Hindu religion. It captures the life-long mission and teachings of Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami [1927-2001]. To bring the purest Saivism to the West, he founded Kauai Aadheenam on Kauai, Hawaii, where he carried on the teachings of his Satguru, Siva Yogaswami [1872-1964] from Sri Lanka.</p>
