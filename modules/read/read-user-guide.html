The app keeps track of where you stop reading. Let's say you ended with a page in "Chapter 1." If you would like to start at "Chapter 1" tomorrow, just tap on the Journal, second from left, while you are in "Chapter 1." If you go out, (tap on the left arrow) and look at the "Journal." There is an entry to go back to "Chapter 1." Tomorrow, go to the Journal. Tap on "Chapter 1" and you will be taken to the publication in a browser. Keep reading. Then, you will have Journal entry that says "Chapter 2" which you can go through in the days ahead.

In fact, you can create Journal entries for more publications. Delete any Journal entry which is old.
