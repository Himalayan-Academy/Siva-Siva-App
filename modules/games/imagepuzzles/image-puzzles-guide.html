Make a Puzzle

  <p>
You will be taken to an image that has 9 tiles. Your goal is to get them in order, so that you see the glorious image!
  </p>
 
 
 <p align="center"><b><font size="20">Tiles That Glow</font></b></p>
 
  <p>
If they glow, that means they are not in a position of order. If you still click, and they glow, that means they can be taking to any possible location - 3 across and  3 down.
  </p>

  <p>
If they don't glow, it means that they are in the right location. If you click to them, they do not respond. That is because they are in the right order. They are locked in. That is good!
