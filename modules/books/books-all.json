They would explain that, if they chose it, they would have the greatest chance of knowing once and for all the divine purpose and Ultimate Truth of life.

Yet, the average person succumbs to it helplessly, even willingly, lapsing into insane episodes now and again without thinking much about it. Many defend it as a tool they would not live without. Anger is expressed in a wide range of ways. Low-minded individuals take delight in being angry with others and expressing that anger in aggressive and violent waysgang\\nwars, robbery, vandalism and more. They deliberately use anger and violence to get what they want from life. Then there are the mass of generally law-abiding people who live a\\nnormal, working life but are seriously angry on the inside about one thing or another and express that anger regularly in their words and actions. They are angry at life and have neither the means nor the motivation to eliminate this hurtful force from their lives.\"",

      "description": "\"Death is the most fateful experience of each of our lives. But no Hindu really fears death, nor does he look forward to it. Death for the Hindu is merely transition, simultaneously an end and\\na new beginning. Over two thousand years ago Saint Tiruvalluvar wrote that Death is like falling asleep, and birth is like awakening from that sleep. In one\\nof the ancient languages of our religion, the physical body had a name which literally meant that which is always dropping off. When key truths are understood and accepted about the nature of the soul and the cycles of birth, life, dying, death, afterlife and rebirth, all sense of foreboding and fear of death perish. Here we explore those realities.\"",

      "description": "\"Many Hindu families visiting our Hawaii monastery, particularly those with young children, ask if I have any advice for them. I usually respond with one or two general suggestions. I always stress the importance of presenting Hinduism to their children in a practical way so that it influences each child?s life for the better. Hindu practices should, for example, help children get better grades in school and get along well with others. Of course, there is not enough time in a short session to present all the many guidelines that a parent would find useful. Therefore, I decided to write up a full complement of suggestions to be handed to Hindu families in the future who want to know ways to present Hinduism to their kids. You hold the results in your hands: the parent?s guidebook of minimum teachings to convey to children. It is based on the teachings of my satguru, Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, founder of Hinduism Today, distilled from insights he gained from over 40 years of closely working with hundreds of families in a score of nations. This booklet presents a gridwork of character-building designed to augment any tradition or denomination. The key is this: start teaching early and don?t stop until your children leave the home. Even if you did nothing more than what is outlined in these 16 pages, that would be enough to send them on their way as good Hindus, well-equipped to live as happy, effective citizens of the modern world.\"",

The focus on core spiritual practices and development. Dive deep within and open up new realms of inner vision with these other-wordly mind maps.\" \"Basic Maps of the Inner Mind is published by Himalayan Academy. Gurudeva, Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, discovered within superconsciousness the Shum-Tyeif language as a result of his desire to give precise descriptions for the various realms of meditation. The uniqueness of the Shum language is that it gives us specific words, technical terms, so to speak, for different meditative experiences. It is much easier to grasp a concept when there is one word to convey it than talking about the concept in a rambling way because no single word describes it.\\n<br /><br />\\nIn this little spiral bound book, Gurudeva outlines 12 meditations to guide the seeker of the within. Each meditation is a map which leads the meditator deeper and deeper into various peaceful places in the mind. Mamsani are the elementary or basic Shum maps containing a number of important meditation concepts to be mastered.\\n<br /><br />\\nGurudeva gives his personal narrative on how this mystical language came to be. He introduces The Advaitin, a small book he wrote for all those who seek a new look at religion. He calls it the story of awareness.\\n<br /><br />\\nTwelve Shum Meditations is one meditation for each month of the year. It includes a preparation for meditation which systematically leads the meditator into the Mamsani of the day.\\n<br /><br />\\nGurudeva includes a discussion of the seven dimensions of the mind which provide a positive and helpful way of looking at life and understanding the experiences we have on the inward path. The last chapter is learning the shum alphabet and the colors of the first 18 images of the shum alphabet.\"",

      "description": "\"This Educational Insight is the fifth and final chapter in our series on Hindu history for use in US primary and secondary schools. In these few pages, we give a broad overview of India since independence. Reporting on recent history is always a challenge since historians lack the chronological and emotional distance to impartially judge key people, trends and events. But clearly, the foremost accomplishment is that India has remained a united, democratic country since 1947. It escaped the fate of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and neighboring Pakistan, each of which split up. It is also notable that modern India continues to be what India has always been: a deep source of wisdom and practical spirituality valued by societies around the world.

Like preceding chapters, it openly discusses topics that are neglected or covered only briefly in current American curricula. We summarize the political history of India between 1850 and 1947, then tell the story of two influential men: Swami Vivekananda, who presented to the Western world a view of Hinduism as a tolerant, sophisticated faith, and Mahatma Gandhi, who taught the world the power of nonviolent political action. Finally, we explore Hindu food, dress, rites of passage and initiations. Overall, the student is provided a glimpse into the beliefs, traditions, practices and refined culture that enabled Hinduism to survive the onslaught of conquest and colonialism.

It is a 16-page lesson on Hindu history, beliefs and practices for sixth graders written from the Hindu point of view. It is historically sound and acceptable in content and tone to the various denominations of the Hindu community.\\n\\nThe problem with every existing textbook for this grade level is that Hinduism is presented negatively, incompletely and inaccurately. This lesson is patterned after a typical chapter on the Jewish faith in these same books. It deliberately does not follow the specific California standards for presenting the Hindu religion because we believe them to be deeply flawed and contrary to the State\\'s own general rule that teaching material must: 1) be historically accurate, 2) instill in each child a sense of pride in his or her heritage and 3) avoid adverse reflection on a religion. It is our intent that this lesson will serve as a model for US textbooks, providing an authentic depiction of the eminent history and traditions of the faith while giving 10-year-old Hindu students justifiable pride in their religion.\\n\\n<br /><br />In most states teachers are allowed to supplement the textbooks with additional material.

Hatha yoga is founded on a principle of putting the physical body into a position so that the nerve currents in the physical body get tuned up to a perfect pitch. It is like tuning the strings on a violin; if you tune the violin just right, then each string will be in harmony with the\\nother strings.\"",

He had been the president of one of Chicago\\'s major hospitals and involved in the arcane science of nuclear surgery. But his love of humanity, medicine and healing took him into many traditions, ultimately incorporating the Indian Science of Life, Ayurveda, and the Indian astrological science, Jyotish, into his repertoire. Dr. Tandavan\\'s many journeys in India and his years of personal meditation and sadhana under the guidance of Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami endowed him with remarkable, syncretic insights into well-being and being well. He passed in 2003 at age 83, but his articles continue to guide many who need practical, proven techniques and lifestyle changes that will guide them in understanding how the body works, how the mind creates our physical and mental/emotional experiences and how life may be lived fully, joyfully and with a sense of the Divine that breathes life into us all.\"",

In each he depicted typical scenes one might encounter during the festival day, as well as the Gods and Goddesses worshiped. The\\nexplanations of the art were dictated by the artist himself. At family gatherings, parents, grandparents and relatives can elaborate from their childhood experiences.\"",

Belonging to diverse communities, regions, historical periods and composing in different languages, styles and contexts, these poet-saints are bound together through time by their steadfast love of God. \\nThe widespread devotional tradition of India is referred to as the Bhakti Movement. From around the 6th century onwards, as far as historians can tell, regional bhakti poetry has been flourishing in the Indian subcontinent in various local languages. The early Vaishnava and Saiva bhakti saints composed hymns at a time when Jainism and Buddhism were gaining major popularity. In the early seventh and eighth centuries, the Hindu Pallava and Chola kingdoms of southern India were at the height of their power. This, coupled with the burgeoning popularity of the divine songsters, kept Hinduism strong as it faced threats from other faiths. The bhakti environment created by these poet-saints influenced people from all walks of life, royalty and laymen, who were inspired by the pristine devotion of the saints and subsequently redefined their own lives as service to God. \"",

      "description": "\"Rasas, human emotions, can affect and be affected by the four outer koshas. However, the self, is never affected by the rasas. The Sanskrit word rasa has many meanings, including emotion, mood and feeling. Tradition defines nine basic rasas: joy (hasya), fear (bhayanaka), anger (raudra), love (shringar), courage (vira), sadness (karuna), amazement (adbhuta), disgust (vibhatsya) and calmness (shanti). All people experience these emotions.\\n\\nAt an early age, babies smile and laugh when they feel joy. After six months, when mind and ego have unfolded, fear arises. Children who feel insecure may also get angry. At the onset of puberty, the rasa of love begins; it is the predominant rasa of teenagers. During puberty, we want to be a hero. In adolescence we may feel sadness if the prince (or princess) of our dreams still has not come.\\nRasas affect both our body chemistry and our mind. Our body chemistry changes, based on the emotion that is perceived by our mind. For example, fear causes our body to respond with emergency adrenaline. Fear also changes the smell of our bodies and the expression on our faces. \\n\\nWe find the nine rasas in literature, theater and dance. Dancers use their entire bodies to enact various rasas. Musicians strive to generate the right mood to uplift, calm, excite or sadden the audience. Writers and poets play with the rasas in stories about romance, tragedy and extraordinary matters. We leave the theater smiling or gloomy according to the main rasa of the drama. Just as life without rasas is incomplete, literature or film without rasas in proper proportion is deficient.\"",

Thayumanavar, is an out and out scripture for Saints and Yogins. It covers the entire field of Yoga and Jnana. It brings high solace to house-holders purifying their mind and heart. It feeds the flames of inner communion in real Yogins. There is not a single Tamilian who does not sing Thayumanavar and find joy in it. Every home cherishes it. Every mother puts her child to bed with its sweet symphony. The hymns of Thayumanavar are sublime music of the Soul, the song of the inner Spirits, and sparks of Divine Essence. It is very difficult to render them into another language. Any how I have ventured to do it during my silent hours of inner Communion with the immortal Spirit of the Saint. Now readers, imagine that the Saint is sitting in your heart while reading these rhythmic lines in deep ingathered tranquillity.

Here is the fruit of those efforts, the gentle, profound world of Asian ethics and simple humanness. Yet, <i>Weaver\\'s Wisdom\\'s</i> universality makes it a book you can share with anyone. It contains fortune cookies you can snack on before sleep or at anytime. Its charming wit and common sense will uplift and inspire you and your whole family.\"",

Overall, the lists and descriptions are surprisingly similar, echoing certain key concepts--generally, that it is conduct, based upon belief in dharma, karma and reincarnation, which makes one a Hindu. Some of the beliefs listed are not shared by all Hindus--most prominently the concept of avatar, divine incarnation, which is a distinctive Vaishnava belief. We shall now cite what has been collected from distinguished scholars and saints.\"",

The silver-white hair and beard along with the spotlessly white raiment he wore were symbolic of his saintliness and sanctity. He traversed the length and breadth of his country and transformed the lives of many who otherwise would have gone astray. <br /><br />\\nThe epoch in which he lived saw many an upheaval of regeneration and much degeneration of cherished values as well. But amidst all the transient phenomena he was as firm as Mount Kailas - a refuge to souls in distress and despair. He infused faith in his devotees and led them out into the light of hope and happiness.\\nEven those whose contacts with him were casual or cursory had a glimpse of the spiritual significance of life.\\n<br /><br /> \\nThe contents of this book are sayings of Yogaswami, a realised soul who lived in Sri Lanka from 1872-1964. They are extracts from the notebooks of a few of his followers, who made it a practice to write down all that they could remember after each meeting with him. Some of these were spoken directly in English, and the remainder have been translated from the original Tamil. Yogaswami had many devotees who were drawn to him from all walks of life and from every background. He would know immediately what was best for each one and would give to each what he most needed.  By four of his disciples: Markanduswami, Chellathuraiswami, Sandaswami, M. Srikhanta\"",

Many who practice such yoga do so solely for health benefits. However, others pursue yoga, in a deeper sense, in hopes of reaping the spiritual benefits it offers. It is to these spiritual seekers who have higher consciousness as the goal of their yoga that this Educational Insight is directed.

      "description": "\"Welcome to lion sage, a spiritual adventure for children. Adapting an earlier work by Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, called Mystic Mouse, the editors of Hinduism Today magazine enlisted Ashley Moore in California to redraw all of the art, adding color and her creative ability to tell stories with graphics. Ashley spent many months conceiving the ideas and executing them in the style you will soon discover. The cover (of this magazine and the book) is by Kerala muralist Manikandan Punnakkal. Lion Sage is a child\\'s version of the metaphysical masterpiece Merging with Siva. It teaches children how to face life\\'s challenges, but most importantly informs them of their true identity. They are not the body which suffers now and then. They are not the emotions that well up in good times and not so good times. They are not the thinking mind. They are light and love; they are an immortal soul on a path of self-discovery. Knowing this one truth can alter a young life forever.\\n\\nAs you take your children through these pages, you are providing a deep comprehension of life and values that few people have. You are teaching them to live in the now and not dwell on the past or worry about the future. You are strengthening their self-esteem, their ability to solve problems and cope with relationships. You are giving them tools to create a happier, less stressful childhood. You are erasing much of the negativity that the outside world rushes to burden them with. And you are endowing them with the basic wisdom of Saiva Siddhanta, the profound spiritual path of South India that the author embraced and lived. And, who knows, maybe you are inspiring yourself a little in the process.\\n\\nNo doubt you, as parent or teacher, will be called upon to answer many questions, to elucidate some of the more obscure concepts. You can also add your own insights and stories for the child. Your anecdotes about the eternal now, or about the importance of letting go will be an essential part of the story of the mouse and the lion. Be the lion when called upon to bring clarity to the adventure. As Lion Sage might say, \\\"\"Are you ready?\\\"\" These pages contain two of the nineteen chapters of Lion Sage.'\"",

For the first time. a long-neglected and much needed rendering into modern Tamil is included, making the obscure verses accessible to one and all. Here is the fruit of those efforts-the gentle, profound world of Asian ethics and simple humanness. Yet, Tirukural\\'s universality makes it a book you can share with anyone.
