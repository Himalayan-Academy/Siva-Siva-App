<b>Bug in an iPhone</b>
<br /><br />
With iPhone, if you click on screen that goes for text, it will go with you to landscape/portrait. But, if you click on the image, it becomes larger. If it is enlarged, there are the buttons, but you cannot go the landscape/portrait. Only when you click five times, then the picture goes back to normal, then you turn your iPhone to goes landscape/portrait -- the icons, two arrows, comes through. Is this a bug is iPhone. But, really, landscape is best, because you swipe around to get a close up.
