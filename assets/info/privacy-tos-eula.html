<p></p>
<p>Himalayan Academy (the publisher of this website and various apps) and its Digital Products and Services (including the Hinduism Today online and Digital App Editions) never sells or gives away any information about, or supplied by, its users, to a third party. In order to facilitate users' experience, our apps do keep track of your sessions. This is done in order to provide users a history-journal of their activities, bookmarks, favorites, playlists and other settings they may use to customize and personal their app experience. This also allows us to determine what parts of the app are most successful and widely used. To do this, we may assign each user a random identification number which includes a date of installation such as</p>
<p></p>
<p align="center"><b>A1Z24_February-02-17</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Although we may store in the cloud your user ID and history of activities with our apps, this information is only attached to the random ID and is completely anonymous, unassociated with your name and personal information. We do not know your name or your email address. We also do not access any personal information outside of our app that may be on your device.  If any of our apps need to access your mobile device's services, such as the camera, location service, audio recording, etc., our apps request and receive your permission before doing so. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Some of our apps may offer opt-in settings where you can voluntarily supply a username, email address, country, city, age, gender, birth date, phone number (for messages, notifications), and your social network log-ins. This would allow our apps to let you share on Facebook, Twitter, What's App and other social networks, and enable notifications in the future. At a minimum, although we cannot guarantee it, if you provide a user name and email address, in the event that you lose your phone or computer or wipe your device data, all of your journal activity, history, bookmarks, favorites, playlists and other custom settings may be restored. None of this information would ever be released to a third party for any reason. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Information related to sharing via your other social app accounts is never stored in the cloud by our apps. Your Twitter, Facebook, What's App log-in information is stored on your device, remaining private to you, and we do not keep this information. In the event of restoring settings, you would need to reenter information for sharing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you choose not to provide a user name and email address, then your journal, history, bookmarks, favorites, customization settings, etc., will be lost in the event that you lose your phone or computer or wipe your device data.</p>

As between the parties, title, ownership rights and intellectual property rights in and to the Software and the Files, and any copies or portions thereof, shall remain with Himalayan Academy and its suppliers or licensors. Licensee understands that Himalayan Academy may modify or discontinue offering the Software or the Files at any time. The Software and the Files are protected by the copyright laws of the United States and international copyright treaties. This Agreement does not give Licensee any rights not expressly granted herein. Licensee shall not export, import or transfer Software contrary to U.S. Export Administration Regulations or other applicable laws, whether directly or indirectly, and will not cause, approve or otherwise facilitate others, such as agents or any third parties, in doing so.

<p></p>
<p><b><font color="#673227">4) SUPPORT AND UPGRADES</font></b></p>

<p><b><font color="#673227">5) WARRANTY DISCLAIMER </font></b></p>
<p>Himalayan Academy and its licensors provide the software and the files "as is," and without warranty of any kind, and hereby disclaim all express or implied warranties, including without limitation warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, performance, accuracy, reliability and non-infringement. Himalayan Academy and its licensors do not and cannot warrant the performance or results you may obtain using the software. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this agreement.

The foregoing limitations shall apply even if Himalayan Academy or its licensors have been informed of the possibility of such damages. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation and exclusion may not apply to licensee.</p>

<p><b><font color="#673227">7) TERM AND TERMINATION</font></b></p>
<p>This Agreement shall continue until terminated as provided for herein. Licensee may terminate this Agreement at any time.

This Agreement may be amended only by a writing executed by both parties or the user&sbquo;&Auml;&ocirc;s agreement to new terms published with upgrades of the Software. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. The failure of Himalayan Academy to act with respect to a breach of this Agreement by Licensee or others does not constitute a waiver and shall not limit Himalayan Academy's rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches. This Agreement is personal to Licensee and may not be assigned or transferred for any reason whatsoever (including, without limitation, by operation of law, merger, reorganization or change of control) without Himalayan Academy's consent; and any attempt to do so shall be void.
