<ul type="disc">
    
     <li><b>Listen: </b>  We have completely re-made the play back option. It is on one screen. With a duration and play back, timestamp. You will be able to "Pause" and "Play" the audio. There is a Journal option to get the timestamp. This is for long talks. If you listen to 15 minutes of an hour talk, you can pick it up the next day at 15 minutes into the audio. See "User Guide". You will not "Seek Forward" or "Seek Back". These are features for a future version.

     </li>
     
    <li><b>Stories: </b>  We have completely re-made the slides option. They are going to be landscape or portrait. But, if you are on the images, if you tapped on them, they are enlarged. Now, you can look around by dragging the photo with your finger. <i>But</i> if they are enlarged, they <i>can't</i> be switched to landscape or portrait. But, if you tap/click 4 times, they land in their original (small) size, and they <i>will</i> go to landscape or portrait.

    </li>
    
    <li><b>Journal: </b>  We have re-done the Journal. It now only records things you choose with the Journal icon, to the bottom, left:

<p align="center">October 15, 2019</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>We have completely revised the navigation of the app. Based on users' suggestions it was simplified to a fast and easy to use menu. This has made the app more responsive.</li>
		<li>A "Story" is available on start up. We are presenting three slideshows based on quotes from Yogaswami, Auvaiyar and Tirukural. You can leave the story at any time. When you come back to the home, it will pick up where you left off.</li> 
<li>New images of Lord Siva on the home screen are rotated over time.</li>
<li>More upgrades on the Word Puzzle: "Reveal" now shows the quote for 2 seconds.</li>
	<li>Now many modules in the app are responsive and take the size of the phone that they appear on.</li>
		<li>Other small bugs and fixes were made.</li>
</ul>
	
<p></p>
<p align="center"><b>Known Issues</b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>When you leave a landscape view/module and go back portrait, we had to introduce a blank, black screen to prevent distortion. We hope to fix this in the future.</li>
<li>Our app work with and without connection to the internet. But those modules that required a connection may cause trouble in very low bandwidth context. For example, 1 bar in 3G. We would appreciate feedback on this issue. Later we may disconnect the app from the internet if bandwidth falls below a certain limit.</li>

<p align="center"><b>Changes in Version 1.4.2</b></p>
<p align="center"> June 12, 2019</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>A bug was fixed -- in the <b>Listen</b> module, when you tried to download music to My Audio, the app would quit. We hope this was solved. We also fixed a bug where navigation from one module the next would give you a blank, black screen. </li>
	<li>Major improvement on navigation across the whole app.</li>

	<li><b>New Music Categories:</b> We now include <i>Classical Music</i> and <i>Popular Music</i> categories in the Listen module. Popular music is defined by those who produce via mixers, electronic drum beats, sound boards etc. <i>Classical Music</i> typically uses some real instruments, may be done in studios or on stage by professionals. We can also now play high quality <i>.m4a</i> files. </li>

	<li>We are pleased and very grateful that Umakant and Ramakant Gundecha gave us permission to use their music. Their famed <i>Shiva Bhaktimala II</i> has been added.</li>

	<li>In Popular Music category we have Natchintani songs by Sanje Siva (Sanjeevan Sivakumaran) from London and songs Kulagen Mooneeswamy from Mauritius. </li>

	<li>In the amateur category we have a beautiful new Carnatic singer, Uma Satkunasivam. You will enjoy her charming soprano renditions of Natchintanai. She kept the gamakam (complex Carnatic vocal ornamentation) to a minimum, so that you can follow along with her tunes.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<p align="center"><b>Changes in Version 1.4</b></p
<p align="center">April, 2019, Hindu New Year Release!</p>


    <ul type="disc">
<li>A complete new opening and interface to the Portal Navigation. The opening has content -- in this case a slideshow that has quotes from <i>Words of Our Master</i> (more "stories" to come in future versions)</li>
<li>Navigation to the Portals and Modules is available on two screens without scrolling</li>
<li><i>My Home</i> has been added. If you 
<ul> <li>a) go to Journal </li>
<li>b) click an item as a "Favorite", it will be added to "My Home", so that you can navigate quickly to those items.</li> </ul>
<li>We have, hopefully, provided a very robust method testing the internet connection. The app tells you whether you  can or cannot access certain content, without blocking further action. </li>
<li><i>Gems</i> quote are not save to Journal. But a "heart" icon has been added. If you like a quote. Click the heart and it will be saved to the journal. This was you can go back to meditate on that one quote.</li>
<li>The <i>Word Puzzle</i> will now accept multiple occasions of the same word at multiple locations. What this means is words like "the, and, of," etc. you can put the words at any location where they fit the grammar of the sentence. With the exception of a word with a period after it. They must go to the end to the sentence.</li>
<li><i>Path to Siva</i> now as clear navigation between lessons.</li>
<li><i>Look,</i> which dedicated to video, now opens automatically to landscape format.</li>
<li>Although quitting an app is available on any device via the native system. Some users asked for closing app while it in. Now you can go to Settings and click "Close App."
</li>
<li><i>Hindu Calendar</i> or <i>Hindu Panchangam</i>had several bugs. These, and numerous others were fixed.</li>

</ul>

<p></p>
<p align="center"><b>Changes in Version 1.3</b></p
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
	<li>A complete upgrade to Listen module, bringing collections, better search options and a screen for you to view all your downloaded audio files. Audio will play throughout to app. A speaker button is shown, which can be used to silence it.</li>
	<li>The "My Data" module in settings allows users to delete date from phone</li>
	<li>Under "Practice" is Hindu Calendar, which allows you to download the panchangam for your area. From here you can view the "sankalpa" chant for you puja. Note that all cities are not listed. Take the one closest to you, in longitude and latitude.</li>
	<li>A new "Lexicon" is available from the "Read" portal. You do not have to on line to view the word.</li>
	<li>Numerous bugs were fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p align="center"><b>Changes in Version 1.1</b></p
<p></p>
	<ul>
			<li>Impediments to iPad installation removed</li>
			<li>Background execution enabled. SivaSiva app no longer automatically quits when you go to another app on your device. You could be reading the daily lesson, in the middle of a puzzle or listening to a song. If you have to stop and take a phone call, or switch to Instagram or email etc. you can click back on SivaSiva app and return exactly where you left off.  We decided, for now, unless here it huge demand, not to have background audio on, as not all users appreciate having the sound continue when they leave the app.  Background audio will continue in app itself. Hit the gear and the audio icon to turn it off.</li>
			<li>Portals screen fixed to scroll smoothly</li>
			<li>Portal screens color themes upgraded</li>
			<li>Major change in the navigation engine. It now moves directly from one module to another with no "in between" screen</li>
			<li>Tap zones for many arrows enlarged so that app feels more responsive. You don't have to touch the arrow exactly for the app to respond. (Still more to do there) </li>
			<li>Upgraded image quality on portal screens</li>
			<li>By popular request: major change to Surprise module: when viewing a collection of quotes, moving forward will choose another random quote, but from the same collection.</li>
			<li>Journal entries for Surprise model more robust in returning to the media you were at; but still random selection. For verses you return to the collection you were in.</li>
			<li>Fixed a crash problem with moving in and out of the Journal. We needed to simplify the engineering behind this, so the back arrow on the Journal always takes you Home, unless you go to a web page via the Journal, in which case the back arrow will take you back to the Journal.</li>
			<li>Fixed a probem in Surprise Audio where rapidly tap next arrow to go a different audio would evoke and"Existing controls" error... hopefully this has gone away.</li>
			<li>Cosmetic closure "Aum Tat Sat" added to the end of the daily lesson so users know they have reached the end.</li>
			<li>Known issue:  Some contexts mysteriously require two clicks to get a response. Then later, one will suffice.</li>
