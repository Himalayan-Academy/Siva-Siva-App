<p align="center"><b><font size="20">Overview</font></b></p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p>"SivaSiva" is a revered mantra from South India naming the divine within all. This app is a portal to the ancient, profound wisdom and rich culture of that tradition, retooled for the 21st century. It seeks to reach today's mobile generation who seek to understand Eastern metaphysics, find spiritual roots and enjoy authentic spiritual experience.</p>
 <p></p>
<p>SivaSiva offers inspirational quotes to uplift your day, awesome photos and art, access to an extensive audio library, YouTube videos and more. Use the app to learn the basics of Saivite Hinduism by diving into the Path to Siva book, which is resident in the app even if you are off line. Read the daily Master Course lessons and practice Color Meditation. The entire current issue of Hinduism Today magazine is available inside the app. Quotes from books give you instant access to their source. A Shortcuts tracks your history. Tap favorites to come back to them tomorrow. Send time with the Word Puzzle and learn key concepts. And have fun with image tiles of the Image Puzzles. SivaSiva is a tool for all those who seek daily spiritual upliftment.</p>
<p></p>
<p> The SivaSiva App is follows the model of the popular Asian "Megaapp" &mdash; which is like going to a giant super mall, a one space in which many needs are met. It is one large app that serves multiple needs that once would take many small apps. </p>
<p></p>
<p>A big challenge and requirement for this app comes from the age and interest levels of our users, who range from 14-year-olds who know little about Hinduism, all the way up to 80-year-old devotees who are knowledgeable and dedicated Saivite Hindus steeped in the tradition.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sometimes the question is asked, "How is this different from your website?" The answer is that users have limited time to choose from a vast wealth of content, and this app uses a strong "push" model that offers access to the culture and teachings without requiring users to search for things. It also offers in-app content that the user can access while offline without a connection.  The SivaSiva app is a curated approach to content delivery, tailoring access to the needs of a mobile generation</p>
<p></p>
<p>Given the breadth of content and user needs, providing navigation and easy access to areas of specific interest is a huge challenge. Version One of the app offers powerful tools, but we still have a long way to go. You can expect more interesting and fun ways to access content in future versions, as well as more content that can be accessed when you have no internet connection. When we send out an upgrade, you can go to the Release Notes for details  about the update and new features .</p>

<p align="center"><b><font size="20">Navigation Model/Portals</font></b></p>
<p></p>
<p> Based on our focus group studies, we have various "Portals." The first two provide one or two clicks to content for users on the go, for that one minute at the bus stop or down time during a meeting. The other portals take you to second-level navigation. From there you can access specific website areas or view in-app modules. Here are the Portals: </p>
