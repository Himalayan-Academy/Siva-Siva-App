 <p>
Your bandwidth, that is a connection to the internet, be it fast WiFi, a slow WiFi or cellular connection, whether is it a high bandwidth or a cellular connection that is very little. Take for example, your in a car, going through a tunnel - cellular connection is very bad. Then, you are going to a place where cellular connection is high. The modules of that require connection to the internet, maybe fast, or will take some patient or they won't work at all.
