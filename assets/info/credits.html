<p>Ultimately, all credit goes to God, Gods and Guru.  God Siva is described in the Yoga Sutras as <i>Ishwara</i>, the first teacher. This app is our humble attempt to channel that inspiration that pours from the Divine as a river of grace down to us through time at this very moment. The app's name is derived from an ancient mantra found in the <i>Saiva Agamas,</i> <i>SivaSiva,</i> which means literally "The Auspicous, the Auspicious."  </p>

<p>In 1985, the founder of Kauai's Hindu Monastery, Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, affectionately known as Gurudeva, walked into an Apple store on the island of Kauai and walked out with his first Macintosh. After a few weeks with this new tool, he decided that all the monks should have one. He called one of the monks at his monastery in San Franscisco and announced, "Your Apple Macintosh is coming. Go and get some classes on how to use it. This is the future."  That young monk opened the computer and booted up a program called "Hypercard,"  wrote his first lines of code and never looked back. By 1995 we had content up on web servers on the internet.  This app continues that evolution, using a mix of  21st-century xTalk in the form of LiveCode, HTML5, SVG and audio/visual content leveraged largely with Adobe Creative Suite. The app draws on talents and skills of professionals and volunteers in six different countries and on resources gathered by Himalayan Academy over four decades.</p>
