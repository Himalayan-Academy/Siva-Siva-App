Nandinatha Sutras: 
Respect for Saints and Dignitaries

SŪTRA 247: OBEY YOUR GURU, OBEY YOUR GURU...
Śiva’s devotees obey their satguru, carrying out his directions, expressed or implied, with intelligent cooperation, without delay. They keep no secrets from him, nor advise others how to manipulate his decisions. Aum.
